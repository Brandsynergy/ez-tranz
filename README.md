## 🚀 Quick Start Guide (For Non-Coders)

### Step 1: Get Your Stripe Keys 🔑

Think of Stripe keys like passwords for your payment system.

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/register
2. Create a free account
3. After signing in, click **"Developers"** in the menu
4. Click **"API keys"**
5. You'll see two keys:
   - **Publishable key** (starts with `pk_test_...`)
   - **Secret key** (starts with `sk_test_...`) - Click "Reveal test key"
   
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Keep these keys safe! Don't share them with anyone.

### Step 2: Update Your App Keys 🔧

1. Open the file: `public/app.js`
2. Find line 2 that says:
   ```javascript
   const STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = 'pk_test_...';
   ```
3. Replace the long string with YOUR publishable key from Stripe

4. Create a file called `.env` (in the main folder)
5. Add these two lines (using YOUR keys):
   ```
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_secret_key_here
   STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_publishable_key_here
   ```

---

### Step 3: Test Locally (On Your Computer) 💻

1. Open **Terminal** (on Mac)
2. Type these commands one by one:

```bash
cd /Users/mediad/mobile-payment-terminal
npm install
npm start
```

3. Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:3000
4. You should see **EZ TRANZ**! 🎉

**To test payments**, use Stripe's test card:
- Card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Expiry: Any future date (e.g., 12/25)
- CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)

### Step 4: Deploy to Render.com 🌍

Now let's put your app online so anyone can use it!

#### A. Connect Your Code to GitHub

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Name your repository: `ez-tranz`
3. Click **"Create repository"**
4. In Terminal, run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/mediad/mobile-payment-terminal
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - EZ TRANZ"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ez-tranz.git
git push -u origin main
```

*(Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your GitHub username)*

#### B. Deploy on Render.com

1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click **"New +"** → **"Web Service"**
4. Connect your GitHub repository: **ez-tranz**
5. Render will automatically detect settings from `render.yaml`
6. Click **"Advanced"** and add your environment variables:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = your secret key
   - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` = your publishable key
7. Click **"Create Web Service"**

⏳ **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete.

8. Once done, you'll get a URL like: `https://ez-tranz.onrender.com`
